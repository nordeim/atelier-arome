# Sample Thinking Process
The user is asking me to design a stunning, refreshing, trendy static HTML mock-up for "Atelier Arôme" - an artisanal aromatherapy e-commerce platform with an "Illuminated Manuscript" Renaissance-inspired aesthetic.

Let me deeply analyze this request:

PHASE 1: DEEP ANALYSIS
Understanding the Brand & Vision
Atelier Arôme = "Workshop of Aroma/Fragrance" (French)

Artisanal aromatherapy products
Singapore market (GST 9%, PayNow, SingPost, SGD)
Illuminated Manuscript aesthetic = Medieval/Renaissance decorated manuscripts with gold leaf, intricate borders, botanical illustrations, calligraphic text
Design Direction Analysis
The "Illuminated Manuscript" concept is rich and specific. Let me break it down:

Historical Reference Points:

Medieval manuscripts (500-1500 CE)
Gold leaf illumination
Intricate botanical borders and marginalia
Decorated capitals (drop caps)
Hand-lettered calligraphy
Vellum/parchment textures
Rich but limited color palettes (ultramarine, vermillion, gold, forest greens)
Typography Stack (from brief):

Cormorant Garamond - Elegant serif (body, headings)
Crimson Pro - Classic serif (secondary)
Great Vibes - Script/calligraphic (accents, decorative)
Color Palette Exploration (Renaissance-inspired):

Deep forest greens (botanical)
Warm golds and ambers (illumination)
Cream/parchment backgrounds (manuscript pages)
Rich burgundy/crimson accents
Deep navy/ultramarine (rare, precious pigment feel)
Soft sage greens (herbs, aromatherapy)
I need to incorporate ornate borders, botanical illustrations, and decorative drop caps throughout the design. Gold foil effects using CSS gradients and SVG will enhance the illuminated quality, while subtle parchment textures ground the aesthetic. Hand-drawn decorative elements and alchemical symbols reinforce the aromatherapy heritage and craftsmanship story. The target audience—premium product seekers who value artisanal quality and wellness—will respond to this sophisticated, heritage-driven visual language that feels both timeless and intentional.

The decorative richness must enhance the hierarchy rather than compete with product information. I'm balancing aesthetic complexity with clean product presentation, ensuring the Renaissance-inspired elements guide attention rather than distract. This means restraint in placement and purposeful use of ornamental details.

For implementation, I'm working within static HTML that transitions to Next.js 15, using Tailwind CSS 4.0 while maintaining WCAG AAA compliance and sub-2-second load times. Reduced motion support is essential. The design deliberately moves away from generic e-commerce conventions—no standard card grids or predictable hero sections—instead favoring asymmetric layouts with intentional whitespace and decorative framing that feels distinctly curated.

The concept frames the entire experience as pages from an illuminated manuscript, where products become treasures displayed with narrative context. Asymmetric editorial layouts with generous margins create a folio-like structure, botanical motifs provide framing, and typography itself becomes decorative through drop caps and varied scales. The color approach emphasizes warm tones anchored by gold accents, creating that alchemical workshop atmosphere.

For the hero, I'm moving away from a standard full-bleed image toward a centered, framed composition featuring an ornamental initial letter and script tagline against a subtle parchment texture, with animated botanical corners adding movement. Products aren't arranged in grids but rather float within an editorial layout of varying sizes, paired with botanical illustrations and alchemical symbols that appear on hover, connected by gold accent lines. Collections function as chapters with decorated headings and drop caps, while the about section uses a two-column format with marginalia-style annotations and a signature element to reinforce the artisan identity.

The newsletter signup incorporates a wax seal graphic with script typography and refined form styling, the footer adopts a traditional book colophon aesthetic with centered, minimal treatment and botanical dividers, and the color system anchors everything in warm, literary tones—parchment backgrounds, ink-dark text, gold accents for highlights and interactive states, with vermillion as a supporting accent.

Typography follows a major third scale across three serif families: Cormorant Garamond for display work, Crimson Pro for body copy, and Great Vibes for decorative script elements, scaling from 10px at the smallest to larger display sizes.

The implementation starts with semantic HTML structure and accessibility features, then layers in custom CSS properties for the theme, Google Fonts, and the typography scale. Section design work begins with the hero component and continues through remaining page elements.

Decorative work involves SVG botanical ornaments, gold foil effects, drop caps, and border frames with subtle animations. The final phases address responsive design with mobile-first approach, accessibility requirements like reduced motion and ARIA labels, then performance optimization and cross-browser testing.

Before moving forward, I'm validating that this approach satisfies the core constraints. The design direction is genuinely original—distinctive typography, unconventional layouts, and a rich visual language that avoids template aesthetics. Accessibility is built in through semantic HTML, WCAG AAA color contrast, motion alternatives, and proper focus states. Performance stays lean with CSS decorative effects, scalable SVG ornaments, and minimal JavaScript. The overall aesthetic coheres around a Renaissance manuscript concept.

Now I'm ready to build the implementation. I'll construct a complete, production-ready static HTML mock-up that captures the "Illuminated Manuscript" aesthetic for Atelier Arôme, incorporating full HTML structure, embedded CSS with utility patterns and custom styling, SVG decorative elements, responsive behavior, subtle animations with motion preferences respected, and full accessibility compliance.
